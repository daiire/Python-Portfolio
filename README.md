# Python-Portfolio

Welcome to my Python repository portfolio! This repository features a collection of projects and code that demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, analysis and report creation.

While I do not have a lot of experience with Pyhton, I wanted to document my progress and showcase my abilities and work. 


# US Census Data Cleaning

Simple data cleaning with Python.

Importing multiple CSVs with Glob and contactinating them into a single dataframe.

Removing duplicates, replacing nan values with zero, splitting and renaming columns where needed.
