# Python-Portfolio

Welcome to my Python repository portfolio! This repository features a collection of projects and code that demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, analysis and report creation.

While I do not have a lot of experience with Pyhton, I wanted to document my progress and showcase my abilities and work. 



# 📊 Report Generation

## 🐾 [Endangered Species Observations Report Generation and Analysis](https://github.com/daiire/Python-Portfolio/tree/888047d67a9635422d620b6cb16d4f5ba17e4abd/NatPark%20Biodiversity](https://github.com/daiire/Python-Portfolio/tree/ea64993b1454abee8b265cd33fe99a4c6870ac63/NatPark%20Biodiversity))

This project analyzes endangered species observation data across multiple national parks and generates visual and PDF reports for conservation insights.

<details> <summary>The workflow includes:</summary>

• Data import: loading species information and park observation data from CSV files.

• Data cleaning: standardizing species common names, filling missing conservation statuses, and creating protected/not protected flags.

• Aggregation & analysis: summarizing species counts by category, protection status, and park, with a focus on endangered species.

• Visualization: generating barplots of endangered species observations by park, formatted for readability with wrapped labels, grids, and clear legends.

• Automated reporting: creating styled PDF tables of observations, including color-coded headers and category groupings for easy interpretation.

• Category-level insights: examining proportions of protected vs. non-protected species across mammals, birds, plants, and other groups.

• Genus-level analysis: identifying clusters of species labeled “Species of Concern,” including a deeper dive into bat populations (Genus Myotis).

• Contextual findings: comparing Myotis bat observations against overall species averages to assess whether low observation counts align with conservation statuses.

This workflow demonstrates practical skills in data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and automated reporting — applicable to conservation research, ecological monitoring, or environmental policy reporting.

## 📈 [Sales Report](https://github.com/daiire/Python-Portfolio/tree/ee380342b649dc42ae54685f4442b8a49c5f25d3/Fictional%20Sales%20Report%20(Class%20%2B%20Report%20Creation))

This project implements a Python class to streamline the preparation of sales reports for management.

<details>
  <summary>The workflow includes:</summary>

• Data import: loading raw period sales reports into a structured format.

• Data cleaning: trimming unnecessary fields and standardizing the dataset for analysis.

• Summary generation: producing key metrics and aggregated tables that highlight performance trends.

• Visualization: creating simple charts to support management’s review and decision-making.

This workflow shows practical skills in data wrangling, reporting automation, and visualization to improve the efficiency of business reporting workflows.

# ✅ Data Cleaning

## 🌦️ [Indonesian Climate Data](https://github.com/daiire/Python-Portfolio/tree/0c4b6affd8b799f9970cd70318492e4fa0e49138/Indonesian%20Climate%20Data)

This project preprocesses raw climate station data to prepare it for analysis and modeling. 
<details>
  <summary>The workflow includes:</summary>

• Data cleaning: renaming columns for clarity, removing stations with insufficient records, stripping whitespace, and handling outliers by replacing invalid values with NaN.

• Outlier detection: applying custom rules for temperature, humidity, sunshine hours, and wind speed and direction to ensure data falls within realistic ranges.

• Missing data handling: using IterativeImputer (a multivariate imputation method) to estimate missing values based on relationships between variables.

• Station-level processing: splitting the dataset by station ID to ensure imputations are tailored to each station’s conditions.

Output: Saving cleaned and completed datasets per station for downstream use (A Power BI dashboard on this dataset is being worked on).

## 👤 [US Census Data](https://github.com/daiire/Python-Portfolio/tree/ee380342b649dc42ae54685f4442b8a49c5f25d3/US%20Census%20(Data%20Cleaning))

This project implements a Python workflow to preprocess and consolidate US Census data. 

<details>
  <summary>The workflow includes:</summary>

• Data import and consolidation: using glob to load multiple CSV files and combine them into a single, unified DataFrame.

• Data cleaning: removing duplicate entries to maintain accuracy and replacing missing values (NaN) with zeros where appicable.

• Column management: splitting and renaming columns where necessary for clarity and consistency.

This script demonstrates practical skills in data wrangling, cleaning, and consolidation, essential for preparing large datasets for analysis.
