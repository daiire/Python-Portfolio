# Python-Portfolio

Welcome to my Python repository portfolio! This repository features a collection of projects and code that demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, analysis and report creation.

While I do not have a lot of experience with Pyhton, I wanted to document my progress and showcase my abilities and work. 


# [US Census Data Cleaning](https://github.com/daiire/Python-Portfolio/tree/ee380342b649dc42ae54685f4442b8a49c5f25d3/US%20Census%20(Data%20Cleaning))

A simple Python workflow for preparing US Census data:

• Import multiple CSV files using Glob and combine them into a single DataFrame.

• Remove duplicate entries to ensure accuracy.

• Replace missing values (NaN) with zeros.

• Split and rename columns where necessary for clarity and consistency.




# [Fictional Sales Report](https://github.com/daiire/Python-Portfolio/tree/ee380342b649dc42ae54685f4442b8a49c5f25d3/Fictional%20Sales%20Report%20(Class%20%2B%20Report%20Creation))

• A Python class that streamlines sales reporting by:

• Importing a period sales report.

• Cleaning and trimming the raw data.

• Generating summary tables for key insights.

• Creating a basic chart to support management’s review and decision-making.
